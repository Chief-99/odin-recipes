# odin-recipes

This is my first ever project. It is to build a
basic recipe website. There will be a main index 
page that will link to a few other recipe pages. 
The goal of this project is to build my technical
HTML skills such as creating a homepage, linking other
pages to it using relative links and setting up a 
basic structure.
