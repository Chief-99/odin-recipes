        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients mac">
            <li>4 cups of macaroni</li>
            <li>Cheddar and/or mozarella cheese (grated)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups of milk (or more as needed)</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup of flour</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (and any other seasoning you would want in the sauce)</li> <br> <br>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2> 
        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Grease a 20 cm square baking dish.</li> <br>
                
                <li>Start making the white sauce. </li> <br>

                <li>Time for the white sauce. Start by melting the butter in a pot at a low heat. Once it has melted, 
                add mix in the flour. They should have the consistency of dough. </li> <br>

                <li>Light one of the plates on the stove. Start pouring the milk into the pot very little at 
                a time and then mix it into the dough until it has the same consistency throughout. It is 
                very important to make sure that you pour in a   little bit of milk at a time because putting 
                too much will cause the white sauce to have lumps. Once the mixture starts to have a 
                consistency of a thick sauce start adding more milk at a time until the sauce is very watery. 
                At this point you can add cheese however this is optional(It will taste good regardless :) </li> <br>

                <li>Put the white sauce onto preheated plate on the stove. This part is very important. As soon 
                the white sauce is on the stove start stirring the pot (make sure you are stirring the whole pot - on 
                the sides and at the bottom). Do not stop stirring the pot until the sauce comes to a boil. If you 
                stop stirring the pot then the sauce will be full of lumps. Once the pot has come to a boil, turn 
                down the heat. Add salt and pepper and whatever other spices you wish to add. My personal 
                favourites are garlic pepper, garlic onion and mixed herbs.</li> <br>

                <li>Cook the macaroni. Heat up a plate on the stove and boil some water - enough to just 
                cover the macaroni when it's in the pot. Put the macaroni in the pot and add salt. 
                Once the water has boiled put the macaroni on the hot plate and cover it with water by 
                about an inch. Make sure to stir the pot when you add the water and then two or three more
                times before it's done. Let it boil for about ten minutes until it's tender, but still firm 
                to eat. It will finish cooking in the oven. </li> <br>

                <li>Once the macaroni is ready your white sauce should be done as well. Drrain the pasta and add 
                to a large bowl. Add the white sauce to the pasta and mix to make sure all the macaroni is coated 
                in sauce.</li> <br>

                <li>Once everything has been mixed together nicely, pour out the pasta into thebaking dish. Sprinkle 
                the cheese over the pasta as you see fit (remember there is no such thing as too much cheese;). Put the 
                dish into the oven and let it bake for about 30 minutes. It should be starting to get golden brown a bit on 
                on the edges. </li> <br>
                
                <li>Once it's done take it out the oven, start serving and enjoy!</li>
