        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Puff pastry sheet **</li>
            <li>Egg whites</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Mincemeat</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (and any other seasoning as you see fit)</li>
        </ul>

        <i>** Take the pastry out of the fridge and defrost it at least half an hour before you <br>
        start cooking. This will make it significantly easier to use.</i> <br> <br>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Chop up the potatoes into very small cubes. Add them to a pan at a moderate heat and start frying them. <br>
            Dice some onions and add them to the same pan.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes have started turning softening and are starting to turn a golden brown colour on the <br>
            outside, add the mincemeat. Fry  the mincemeat until it has browned on the outside but it doesn't have to be cooked <br>
            all the way through as it will finish cooking in the oven. Frying it in the pan with the other ingredients also <br>
            ensures that the flavours are infused nicely into the mincemeat. Once it has cooked, add salt and pepper and any <br>
            seasoning you see fit.</li>
            <li>Score the pastry sheet into about twelve rectangles (this may very depending on the size of your pastry sheet). <br>
            Take the potato-mince mixture and add a spoonful (depending on the size of the teh rectangles) to each rectangle. Once <br>
            that is done, fold over all the rectangles and seal them with a fork. Brush the top of the pies with the egg whites and <br>
            put them in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake them for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Once done let them cool for a few minutes and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>   <br> <br>
