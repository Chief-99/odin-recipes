        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients pies">
            <li>Puff pastry sheet **</li>
            <li>Egg whites</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Mincemeat</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (and any other seasoning as you see fit)</li>
        </ul>

        <i>** Take the pastry out of the fridge and defrost it at least half an hour before you <br>
        start cooking. This will make it significantly easier to use.</i> <br> <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.</li> <br>

                <li>Chop up the potatoes into very small cubes. Add them to a pan at a moderate heat and start frying them. Dice some onions and add them to the same pan.</li> <br>

                <li>Once the potatoes have started turning softening and are starting to turn a golden brown colour on the outside, add the mincemeat. Fry  the mincemeat until it has browned on the outside but it doesn't have to be cooked all the way through as it will finish cooking in the oven. Frying it in the pan with the other ingredients also ensures that the flavours are infused nicely into the mincemeat. Once it has cooked, add salt and pepper and any seasoning you see fit.</li> <br>

                <li>Score the pastry sheet into about twelve rectangles (this may very depending on the size of your pastry sheet). Take the potato-mince mixture and add a spoonful (depending on the size of the teh rectangles) to each rectangle. Once that is done, fold over all the rectangles and seal them with a fork. Brush the top of the pies with the egg whites and put them in the oven.</li> <br>

                <li>Bake them for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Once done let them cool for a few minutes and enjoy!</li>
